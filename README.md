# 🎓 Student Record & Grade Management System (C++)

A **console-based C++ project** to manage student records, calculate grades, and store data persistently.  
This project showcases **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, **Data Structures (Linked List)**, and **File Handling** in action.

## 🚀 Features
- ➕ Add new student records  
- 🔍 Search student by roll number  
- ❌ Delete student record  
- 📜 Display all student records in a tabular format  
- 📝 Store marks of **5 subjects** per student

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- **Arrays** → Store marks of subjects  
- **Pointers** → Manage linked list dynamically  
- **Strings** → Handle student names  
- **Classes & Objects** → Structured OOP approach  
- **Constructors** → Initialize student data  
- **Linked List** → Dynamic storage of student records  
- **`this` Pointer** → To access current object  
- **File Handling** → Save & load records from file (`students.txt`)
